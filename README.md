# Ryan Josh Villaluz — Interactive Portfolio

Welcome to my interactive portfolio — a small experience designed to slow things down, ask a few reflective questions, and then show you who I am and what I build.

This project is intentionally different.  
Instead of a traditional “Here’s my resume and some links,” I wanted to create a short moment of calm for anyone checking me out — employers included. No stress, no noise. Just a quick vibe check before diving into the usual professional stuff.

## 🌟 What This Is

This is a custom-built interactive prompt that:

- Asks you a few reflective questions  
- Types responses in a retro CRT-terminal aesthetic  
- Transitions into my projects, background, and resume  
- Gives visitors a few seconds to breathe before reading about me  

The goal is simple:  
**a small human moment before the professional details.**

## 🔒 Privacy & Data

**I do not store, track, send, or share *anything* you type.**

- Your responses stay inside **your own browser**  
- Stored only via `localStorage`  
- Automatically expire after **14 days**  
- Nothing is sent to a server  
- Nothing leaves your device  

This is a portfolio, not a product — the experience is for *you*.

## ❤️ Why I Built It This Way

Most portfolios feel rushed.  
Most recruiters are rushed.  
Most engineers are rushed.

I wanted to create a space that doesn’t rush you.

A space that feels thoughtful, atmospheric, and a little more human — because I believe the best software is built with attention, intention, and emotion.

Thanks for stopping by.  
I appreciate your time.
